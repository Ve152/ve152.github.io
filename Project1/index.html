            <p>Moscow, on the Moskva River in western Russia, is the nation’s cosmopolitan capital. In its historic core
                is the Kremlin, a complex that’s home to the president and tsarist treasures in the Armoury. Outside its
                walls is Red Square, Russia's symbolic center. It's home to Lenin’s Mausoleum, the State Historical
                Museum's comprehensive collection and St. Basil’s Cathedral, known for its colorful, onion-shaped domes

            <p>Moscow, Russian Moskva, city, capital of Russia, located in the far western part of the country. Since it
                was first mentioned in the chronicles of 1147, Moscow has played a vital role in Russian history. It
                became the capital of Muscovy (the Grand Principality of Moscow) in the late 13th century; hence, the
                people of Moscow are known as Muscovites. Today Moscow is not only the political centre of Russia but
                also the country’s most populous city and its industrial, cultural, scientific, and educational capital.
                For more than 600 years Moscow also has been the spiritual centre of the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>
