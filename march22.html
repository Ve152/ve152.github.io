        Iceland
    </h2>
    </p>
    <p> <dfn><b>Iceland</b></dfn>, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes, geysers,
        hot
        springs and
        lava fields. Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the
        population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga
        museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history. </p>

                Not only is it illegal to sell panties, boxers, thongs, and jock straps with the Icelandic flag on them
                (that would be disrespectful), it is also illegal to sell or advertise items of foreign origin if the
                image
                of an Icelandic flag has been put on them.</p>
